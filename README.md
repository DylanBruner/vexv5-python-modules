  A simple library for creating menus on the screen you can find a example for it in the examples folder
  Note if button presses aren't being registered then just make sure to keep you finger on the button untill it turns white

  Intended for developers


How to install it

On a sd card:
  Clone the repo and copy over the following folders/files:
    modules
    base64.py
    module_loader.py
   
   Plugin the sd card and thats it


Without a sd card:
  If you want to load any of these modules without a sd card then just go into modules and copy the .py version into your project
  But some of the modules will be big so a sd card is recomended
