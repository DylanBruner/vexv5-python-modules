# VEX v5 python modules

More modules coming soon!


Modules:
  1. screenlib
  2. createlib


screenlib:
  A simple library for creating menus on the screen you can find a example for it in the examples folder
  Note if button presses aren't being registered then just make sure to keep you finger on the button untill it turns white


createlib:
  Intended for developers


If you want to load any of these modules without a sd card then just go into modules and copy the .py version into your project
But some of the modules will be big so a sd card is recomended
